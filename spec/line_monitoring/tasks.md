# Tasks: Line Monitoring

## Implementation Plan

### 1. **ConfigSyncer Implementation**
- [ ] **Objective**: Implement Zabbix API integration to fetch line configurations.
  - [ ] Fetch line details (IP, interval, router info) from Zabbix API.
  - [ ] Implement periodic sync mechanism.
  - [ ] Handle API failures with retries and caching.

### 2. **Router Connection Management**
- [ ] **Objective**: Implement connection pooling and lifecycle management.
  - [ ] Use `scrapligo` for router connections.
  - [ ] Implement connection reuse and keep-alive.
  - [ ] Handle connection errors and retries.

### 3. **Task Execution System**
- [ ] **Objective**: Implement platform-specific task execution.
  - [ ] Register tasks (e.g., Ping) for supported platforms.
  - [ ] Implement command batching using `scrapligo` channels.
  - [ ] Parse and validate task results.

### 4. **Scheduler Implementation**
- [ ] **Objective**: Implement interval-based task scheduling.
  - [ ] Create `IntervalTaskQueue` for each line interval.
  - [ ] Handle concurrent task execution safely.
  - [ ] Implement task cancellation and timeout handling.

### 5. **Result Aggregation & Reporting**
- [ ] **Objective**: Implement result compression and reporting.
  - [ ] Batch results for efficient reporting.
  - [ ] Integrate with Zabbix sender for result submission.
  - [ ] Handle reporting failures gracefully.

### 6. **Dynamic Configuration Handling**
- [ ] **Objective**: Handle dynamic changes to line configurations.
  - [ ] Detect and apply configuration changes.
  - [ ] Clean up unused router connections and queues.
  - [ ] Gracefully handle line additions/removals.

### 7. **Error Handling & Logging**
- [ ] **Objective**: Improve error handling and logging.
  - [ ] Add structured logging for critical events.
  - [ ] Implement panic recovery.
  - [ ] Provide contextual error messages.

### 8. **Testing Infrastructure**
- [ ] **Objective**: Set up comprehensive testing.
  - [ ] Write unit tests for core components.
  - [ ] Mock Zabbix API and router interactions for integration tests.
  - [ ] Validate performance under load.

### 9. **Configuration Management**
- [ ] **Objective**: Support flexible configuration.
  - [ ] Add support for config files and environment variables.
  - [ ] Implement secrets management for credentials.
  - [ ] Validate configuration on startup.

### 10. **Extensibility**
- [ ] **Objective**: Ensure the system is extensible.
  - [ ] Design a plugin system for new platforms.
  - [ ] Add health checks and metrics endpoints.
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting for task execution.

## Notes
- Each task includes references to specific requirements from `requirements.md`.
- Tasks are ordered to ensure dependencies are resolved early.
- Testing and error handling are integrated into each phase.
