  - Requirements: 4, 6

### 7. Integration Tests
- [ ] 7.1 Test full pipeline
  - From config sync to result reporting
  - Verify multi-router scenarios
  - Requirements: All

### 8. Performance Testing
- [ ] 8.1 Load test scheduler
  - Measure under high task volume
  - Verify connection pool scaling
  - Requirements: 3, 9

## Implementation Notes
1. Follow test-driven development approach
2. Each task should reference specific requirements
3. Prioritize core functionality first (1.1, 2.1, 3.1)
4. Maintain platform independence in core components
``` 

This implementation plan:
1. Covers all requirements from requirements.md
2. Aligns with design.md architecture
3. Provides clear actionable tasks
4. Includes testing strategy
5. Maintains traceability to requirements

The tasks are organized to:
- Implement core components first
- Support incremental development
- Enable parallel work streams
- Ensure full requirement coverage
